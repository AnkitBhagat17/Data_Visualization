    "Machine Learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into **three main types** based on their learning approach and the nature of the data they work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Supervised Machine Learning  \n",
    "Supervised learning algorithms are trained on **labelled data** to map input features to targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regression**: Predicts continuous values (e.g., house prices, temperature).  \n",
    "- **Classification**: Assigns data to specific categories (e.g., spam detection, disease diagnosis).  \n",

    "#### 2. Unsupervised Machine Learning  \n",
    "Unsupervised learning algorithms identify **patterns in unlabelled data**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of unsupervised learning:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clustering**: Groups similar data points together (e.g., customer segmentation, document grouping).  \n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduces the number of variables while retaining key information (e.g., PCA, t-SNE).  \n",

    "#### 3. Reinforcement Machine Learning  \n",
    "In Reinforcement Learning, an **agent learns by interacting with an environment**, performing actions, and receiving **rewards/penalties**.  \n",
    "It aims to maximize **cumulative reward**.  \n",

    "There are two main types of reinforcement learning:  \n",

    "- **Model-based Reinforcement Learning**: The agent learns a model of the environment to plan actions.  \n",
    "- **Model-free Reinforcement Learning**: The agent learns directly from experience without a model.  \n",
